# Socket-Programming-in-C-Computer-Network
Socket programming simulation in computer networking creates virtual communication endpoints, called sockets, to enable communication between processes over a network. It's used to mimic real-world network scenarios for testing and validating networked applications before deployment.

Here "server.c" establishes a server that listens for client connections, accepts them, and handles communication. "client.c" creates a client that connects to the server, exchanges data, and closes the connection.

#Steps..........
To simulate the network we need to run "server.c" & "client.c" simultaneously
